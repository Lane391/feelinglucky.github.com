<pre>
September, 
late autumn air is crisp. 

Deposit water has receded and cold pond water is clear, 
thin smoke cumulus floating on sky and mountain ranges showing purple at nightfall. 

Sitting in carriage and riding along the high mount path, 
seeking scenic spots among high mounts and towering peaks. 

Arriving at past King Teng's Changzhou, 
finding the palace where celestial beings living. 

Mount ranges rising one higher than another, 
green peaks shooting towards the heavens layer upon layer. 

On sky-high flying pavilion with flowing red ray, 
seeing no ground. 

Cranes and wild ducks dwelling at river islets, 
presenting air of twists and turns; 
elegant cassiabarktree and magnolia wood pavilion, 
ranges of mounts are a perfect pair. 

Opening flower-carved door, 
overlooking coloured roofs,
mounts and planes are under vision, 
heartening seeing twists of lakes and rivers. 
Alleys and households everywhere, 
many are rich in treasures and delicious food; 
boats crowded at the ferry, are colossi with blue birds and yellow dragons carved on. 

Sun shining after rain, clouds and rainbow vanishing, 
sunlight is sound. 

Falling rosy clouds and single wild goose flying wing to wing, 
autumn water and long sky linking up one as one.

Songs rising from nightfall-time fishing boats,
resounding waters of Pengli. 

Wild geese crying for feeling chill, 
reverberating around waters of Hengyang.
